This project aims to create a very small search engine by indexing IDEB data available at [Resultados Ideb](https://www.gov.br/inep/pt-br/areas-de-atuacao/pesquisas-estatisticas-e-indicadores/ideb/resultados).

The server of the search engine is built using FastAPI and the indexes utilize inverted indexes and TRIEs.
The client is built using Angular.
